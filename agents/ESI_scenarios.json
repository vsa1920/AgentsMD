      "scenario": "\"I just turned my back for a minute,\" cried the mother of a 4-year-old. The child was pulled out of the family pool by a neighbor who immediately administered mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. The child is now breathing spontaneously but continues to be unresponsive. On arrival in the emergency department (ED) vital signs (VS) were: heart rate (HR) 126, respiratory rate (RR), 28, blood pressure (BP) 80/64, SpO2 96% on a non-rebreather.",
      "answer": "ESI level 1: unresponsive. This 4-year-old continues to be unresponsive. The patient will require immediate life-saving interventions to address airway, breathing, and circulation."

      "scenario": "A 28-year-old male presents to the ED requesting to be checked. He has a severe shellfish allergy and mistakenly ate a dip that contained shrimp. He immediately felt his throat start to close so he used his EpiPen. He tells you he feels okay. No wheezes or rash noted. VS: BP 136/84, HR 108, RR 20, SpO2 97%, temperature (T) 97° F.",
      "answer": "ESI level 2: high-risk situation for allergic reaction. The patient has used his EpiPen but still requires additional medications and close monitoring."

      "scenario": "\"He was running after his brother, fell and cut his lip on the corner of the coffee table. There was blood everywhere,\" recalls the mother of a healthy 19-month-old. \"He'll never stay still for the doctor.\" You notice that the baby has a 2-cm lip laceration that extends through the vermillion border. Vital signs are within normal limits for age.",
      "answer": "ESI level 3: two or more resources. A laceration through the vermillion border requires the physician to line up the edges exactly. Misalignment can be noticeable. A healthy 19-month-old will probably not cooperate. In most settings he will require conscious sedation, which counts as two resources. The toddler's vital signs are within normal limits for age, so there is no reason to up-triage to ESI level 2."

      "scenario": "A 44-year-old female is retching continuously into a large basin as her son wheels her into the triage area. Her son tells you that his diabetic mother has been vomiting for the past 5 hours and now it is \"just this yellow stuff.\" \"She hasn't eaten or taken her insulin,\" he tells you. No known drug allergies (NKDA). VS: BP 148/70, P 126, RR 24.",
      "answer": "ESI level 2: high risk. A 44-year-old diabetic with continuous vomiting is at risk for diabetic ketoacidosis. The patient's vital signs are a concern as her heart rate and respiratory rate are both elevated. It is not safe for this patient to wait for an extended period of time in the waiting room."

The parents called 911 because their son was out of control: verbally and physically acting out and threatening to kill the family. He is cooperative at triage and answers your questions appropriately. He has no past medical history (PMH), allergies, and is currently taking no medications. Vital signs are within normal limits.",
      "answer": "ESI level 2: high-risk situation. Homicidal ideation is a clear high-risk situation. This patient needs to be placed in a safe, secure environment, even though he is calm and cooperative at triage."

      "answer": "ESI level 4: one resource. This patient will require a laceration repair. A tetanus booster is not a resource."

      "answer": "ESI level 2: new onset confusion, lethargy, or disorientation. The daughter reports that her mother has a change in level of consciousness. The reason for her change in mental status may be a urinary tract infection that has advanced to bacteremia. She has an acute change in mental status and is therefore high risk."

      "answer": "ESI level 2: high risk. This 75-year-old male tried to kill himself by cutting his throat. Because of the anatomy of the neck, this type of laceration has the potential to cause airway, breathing, and/or circulation problems. At the same time, he is suicidal and the ED needs to ensure that he does not leave or attempt to harm himself further."

      "answer": "ESI level 5: no resources. No resources should be necessary. He will require a physical exam but, without signs of an abscess or cellulites, this patient will be referred to a dentist. In the ED he may be given oral medications and prescriptions for antibiotics and/or pain medication. He is not an ESI level 2, even though he rates his pain as 10/10. Based on the triage assessment, he would not be given the last open bed."

VS: HR 72, RR 16, BP 102/60.",
      "answer": "ESI level 3: two or more resources. This patient has a complex medical history and presented with an infected hand. At a minimum she will need labs, an IV, and IV antibiotics to address her presenting complaint. Her vital signs are normal so there is no reason to up-triage her to ESI level 2."

      "answer": "ESI level 2: high risk. Because of the mechanism on injury and his complaints of tingling in both hands, this patient should be assigned ESI level 2. He has a cervical spine injury until proven otherwise. He is not an ESI level 1 in that he does not require immediate aggressive intervention to prevent death. At triage he needs to be appropriately immobilized."

      "answer": "ESI level 3: two or more resources. It looks like this patient has a displaced fracture and will need to have a closed reduction prior to casting or splinting. At a minimum, she needs x-rays and an orthopedic consult. Her vital signs are stable, so there is no need to up-triage her to an ESI level 2. Her pain is currently a 6/10. If she rated her pain as 9/10 and she is tearful, would you up-triage her to an ESI level 2? Probably not, given the many nursing interventions you could initiate to decrease her pain, such as ice, elevation, and appropriate immobilization."
